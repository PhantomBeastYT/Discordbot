# Discordbot
Basic example of a very simple discord bot (no admin commands inclueded (only messaging commands but you can add them))

how to setup - 
you need to install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), open main.js using notepad (I recommend using visual studio code as it will make your work easier.
I have written which line of code you can edit like console.log you can change to whatever you want , after doing the changes go to the end of the
code where it says client.login (put in your discord bot's token) you need to give a token so it can connect to your bot , to get a token go to discord dev portal
(https://discord.com/developers) and create an application after that create a bot and you can easily ctrl+c and ctrl+v the token to that area of the code.
After this open Discord permission calculator , there you can create an invite for your bot and choose what he can manage and on the basis of what you chose 
a role will be created for the bot that will have those permissions, after choosing the permissions copy paste your bot's client id from 'OAuth2' tab in developer 
portal and invite your bot.

How to activate the bot-
To activate the bot open your command prompt (if you are using visual studio just click on  terminal and new terminal it will automatically write your discord bot's
folder destination in it but if you are using cmd copy your discord bot folder's location and write "cd [your folder's location] after that write node. (if you have installed node.js.
As soon as youo write it after 2-3 seconds it should say whatever you wrote in console.log
